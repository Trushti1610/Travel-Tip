    <h3>Travel on Budget</h3>
    <br><img src="budget.jpg" height="300px" width="300px"><br><br>
    <p>
        <h5>Travel Out of Season</h5><br>
        Avoid trips during the school holidays, this is when the travel industry hikes up prices to take advantage of families who can only travel during these weeks. Research the best time to visit your intended destination, and then travel just before or after these dates. This is called the ‘shoulder season’, where you’ll still have a great trip but maybe the sun won’t shine quite as brightly (and, on the plus side, it won’t be quite as hot.) Hotels and airlines lower their prices to attract customers during this time.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>Book Flights in Advance...</h5>
        Especially return flights; running out of money abroad without a guaranteed ticket home is never ideal. Airlines ‘release’ their flight seats up to a year in advance and the closer you get to your departure date, the more the prices increase, especially in the last month.
        <br><br><br>
        <h5>Be accommodation-savvy</h5>
        Trade expensive hotel suites for dorm rooms in hostels. Sharing a room naturally divides the costs and communal bunk rooms offer the opportunity to meet people who might be keen to explore with you. Other great alternatives are websites like AirBnB and Couchsurfing, where you simply book a spare room in a local person’s house or apartment. It’ll halve the price and allow you an authentic snapshot of real life in the city. Consider your host your very own, personal tour guide, filled with insider-tips for the best eateries and tourist spots in that neighbourhood.

        You could even stay with family or friends. Reach out to people you know or plan a trip to somewhere that a long-lost cousin or school friend now lives – this could take you to visit places you’d never have thought of before.
        <h5>Pack properly</h5>
        Make sure you bring everything you need so that you don’t have to shop while you’re away (apart from a few souvenirs). No matter where you’re heading, take at least one pair of long jeans, warm hoodie and waterproof jacket for unpredictable weather incidents. For some in-depth advice, check out our ‘Travel like a pro’ guide to packing for every kind of trip.

    <h3>Food & Drinks</h3>
    <br><img src="food1.jpeg"  height="300px" width="300px"><br><br>
    <p><h4>Best Foods for Traveling by Car</h4><br>
        By the time you turn the corner, everyone in the car is begging for food. While chips and cookies can be fun snacks, you may want something more nutritious. Pack a few good-for-you mess-free meals and snacks. To keep things fresh, bring a cooler.<br><br>
        
        <h5>Meals:</h5>
        
        Whole-grain pasta salad or quinoa salad
        Turkey and cheese sandwich on whole-wheat bread
        Hard-boiled egg and cheese in a whole-wheat pita<br><br>
       <h5>Snacks:</h5>
        
        Sliced fresh fruit like melon and berries
        Snack bar
        Greek yogurt
        Cheese and whole-grain crackers<br><br>
        <h5>If you end up having to hit the grocery store or gas station mart anyway, look for healthier choices.</h5>
        
        Whole-grain pretzels
        Hummus cups
        Coffee or tea (nothing fancy)
        Fresh or dried fruit
        Small bowl of oatmeal
        Best Foods for Traveling By Plane<br><br><br>
        Not all flights provide food and some only give you cookies or pretzels as an option, so if you want to stay on track with your healthy eating goals, advanced planning is a must. If you're counting on purchasing food at the airport or on board, you'll pay a pretty penny, plus not all airports carry healthy fare. Instead, pack a few sandwiches and snacks.
        <br><br>
        <h5>Sandwiches:</h5>
        
        Cucumber and whipped cream cheese on whole-wheat bread
        Peanut butter and jelly on rye
        Grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato and mustard in a whole-grain wrap
        Hummus with sliced tomato, pepper and cucumber in a whole-wheat pita<br><br>
        <h5>Snacks:</h5>
        
        String cheese
        Hummus cups
        Homemade trail mix
        Nonfat Greek yogurt
        Snack bars
        Whole fruit (plums, peaches, banana)
        Cut vegetables (carrots, bell peppers, cucumbers, celery)
        Seaweed snacks<br><br><br>
        <h5>Foods to Pack for the Hotel</h5><br>
        Traveling always makes me hungry, and the last thing I want to do is check into my hotel and run to the vending machine. Instead, I ask ahead if there is a supermarket nearby and if the room has a refrigerator and microwave oven.
        <br>
        At the supermarket, I pick up easy finger foods that require little or no prep, such as fruits, pre-cut veggies or baby carrots, dry roasted nuts, Greek yogurt, and whole-grain cereal and milk. If there's a microwave, I bring snacks like popcorn.
